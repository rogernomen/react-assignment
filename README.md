# Some context before the review
- This project pretends to expose some concepts I've learned through my career like BFF, DDD 
and SOLID principles.

- State management is handled by a mix between React's Context API and React Query
- Tests are done with react-testing-library and Jest
- The functionality it's not fully implemented for a lack of time but most of the topics related to a bigger
development has been covered.
